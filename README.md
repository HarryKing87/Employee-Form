# Employee-Form
For my University, I create an assignment-program that works for receptionists-offices. The program allows employees to be inserted every time and even get edited. I've made this project using MS Visual Studio and Windows Forms. The secretary can insert two types of employees, hourly and salaried, and they can even get edited from a separate button with information autofill.
